# My first Flask and Jinja test.

> Requires Python3

## In this folder, do the following:
### Create a directory for the python virtual environment
`mkdir venv`
### Create a python container/environment
`python3 -m venv venv`
### Enter the sandbox
`source venv/bin/activate`
### Install all python stuff needed
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Start the web app
`python3 app.py`
> Now, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000

## Make available from other computers (on network)
Change the host address in the main app (app.py) to the hosts IP.
Set the port number to something that can be opened in the hosts firewall and
is allowed by other policies...
